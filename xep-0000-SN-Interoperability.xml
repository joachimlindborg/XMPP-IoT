            There are multiple XEP's controlling how different parties exchange information between each other across the XMPP-based sensor network. However, to achieve
            interoperability between products of different manufacturers, common rules need to be adhered to by all parties involved, so data and information can be freely 
            interchanged and understood throughout the network. This document defines such interoperability rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sensor networks contains many different architectures and use cases. For this reason, the sensor network standards have been divided into multiple XEPs according to the following table:

                    are depicted as edges. In abstract terms, it's easier to talk about a Node, than have to list different types of nodes possible (sensors, actuators, meters, devices, gateways, etc.).

                    In physics, precision determines the number of digits of precision. In sensor networks however, this definition is not easily applicable. Instead, precision
                    determines, for example, the number of decimals of precision, or power of precision. Example: 123.200 MWh contains 3 decimals of precision. All entities parsing and
                    delivering field information in sensor networks should always retain the number of decimals in a message.

        <p>
            The basic tool for creating interoperability in large networks where many different devices from many different manufacturers needs to interoperate, is to
            create recognized interfaces with well defined attributes. Each interface represents a contract that the device promises to uphold. It consists of mandatory
			and optional parts. If the device implements any optional funcionality, it must implement them as defined by the corresponding interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            Interfaces are categorized, grouped and named using a sequence of parts separated using period (.) characters. The interfaces in this document all begin with
            "<strong>XMPP.</strong>". Any manufacturer is free to create their own interfaces, however these must start with a name they control, for instance the name of
            the company.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next part name in the name of interfaces listed in this document is "<strong>IoT.</strong>" meaning interfaces related to Internet of Things - i.e. communication
            as specified in the XEPs listed in the <link url='#intro'>Introduction</link>. Here companies creating their own interfaces are free to choose any grouping
            they desire. If the subgroup is not equal to "<strong>IoT.</strong>" and the root is "<strong>XMPP.</strong>", then a corresponding XEP will define the interfaces
            for that subgroup of interfaces. This document thus defines all interfaces starting with "<strong>XMPP.IoT.</strong>".
        </p>
        <p>
            Note also that devices are free to add any number of fields, control parameters, units, etc., as they desire. The interfaces listed here only define a minimum
            of the former, to facilitate interopability. They also list optional extensions that should be adhered to, if used, for the same reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> The author(s) encourage active participation in defining new interfaces or enhancing existing interfaces within the XMPP namespace,
            all in an effort to create as large a communicty as possible that can agree on a set of interoperable interfaces that can be used to interchange information in
            XMPP networks. For more information, please see <link url='#newinterfaces'>Extending the Interoperability Document</link>.

    <section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
        <p>
            This document has not touched upon security in sensor networks. There are mainly three concerns that implementers of sensor networks need to consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Communication should be restricted to friends as long as possible. Approved friendships provide a mechanism of limiting sensor information to authorized and authenticated users.
            </li>
            <li>
                More advanced access rights, privileges, automatic friendship recognition, etc., may be managed by a third party. How to implement more advanced provisioning and detailed
                access rights to sensor information is detailed in the XEP <link url='sensor-network-provisioning.html'>sensor-network-provisioning</link>. In short, a device, service or user can get a
                <strong>deviceToken</strong>, <strong>serviceToken</strong> and <strong>userToken</strong> respectivelly from a provisioning server. The service or device then uses these tokens
                in all readout requests and the device being read out can in turn use these tokens to validate access rights with the provisioning server.
            </li>
        </ul>
